        h2 About Us
        p Soulmates Veterinary Hospital is dedicated to bringing top-notch companion animal healthcare to tier-2 and tier-3 cities across India. Recognizing that while human healthcare has advanced significantly, veterinary care often lags behind, especially in smaller cities, Soulmates was founded to bridge this gap.
        p Started by a passionate doctor couple, Drs Shashikant and Vijayalakshmi Kulgod, who share a deep love for animals, our mission is to provide quality veterinary services where they are most needed. Our first hospital, Ruby Veterinary Hospital, is set to open in Belgaum, Karnataka, by the end of 2024. Equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and a team of skilled veterinarians, Soulmates Veterinary Hospital is committed to enhancing the health and happiness of pets, ensuring that every animal receives the care they deserve.
